# Reflections:
# 03 oct: now, I am liven at MontrÃ©al with my wife, she is studying at Universoty 
# of Montreal and I am without any job. My perspectives are not good, cause
# I am not a specialisty in any area, and IT jobs at Montreal apparently need
# that you be a specialisty. I am studying Android development to try take a job
# and i want to be a android/java specialisty in few months.
# I have start my studies just 4 days ago, and this last 3 days i has study git,
# cause the course of android gived by udacity adviced to make this course before.
# I hope I can take same job as Jr. Developer, nad if I cannot take a job this 
# next week, i will take a job as priduction (industrial) and stuci by nights
# and weekends to take same certification in Java and android, and I will
# make same app to, to use as portifolio to my next search of jobs.
